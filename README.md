# AppleFritter

I originally set out to create a Twitter clone. I wanted it to look, and feel different from Twitter, while retaining the core functionality of Twtiter.

> I have taken the live site down and included images of the site below.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** TypeScript, Next.js, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, Prisma, tRPC, NextAuth

The original version of AppleFritter had a separate backend using Express, with MongoDB, and TypeScript. However, the database very quickly became too much of a hassle to even ATTEMPT to maintain. I completely scrapped the original version, and realized that a relational database would be MUCH better to work with and maintain.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned SO much during the making of this project. I had no prior knowledge with any of the following: Next.js, NextAuth, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and tRPC. I have learned so much about the importance of database design. After working with PostgreSQL, I realize how amazing it is to work with relational databases. Prior to this project, I've only used non-relational databases.
