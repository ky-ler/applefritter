# AppleFritter

**Tech used:** TypeScript, Next.js, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, Prisma, tRPC, NextAuth

The original version of AppleFritter had a separate backend using Express, with MongoDB, and TypeScript. However, the database very quickly became too much of a hassle to even ATTEMPT to maintain. I completely scrapped the original version, and realized that a relational database would be much better to work with and maintain.
